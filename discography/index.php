            <h4>The End is The Beginning</h4>
              <p>Snail&rsquo;s new album, &ldquo;Terminus,&rdquo; showcases all fresh material, infused with the enthusiasm of newly minted collaboration. Influences that were not evident in past works come to the fore, steeped in early-eighties proto-metal and psychedelia. The subject matter is noticeably more mature, as the entire record delves into the themes of mortality and its implications in our modern world. The name Terminus is latin and translates as &quot;boundary stone.&quot; It signifies both the death of the old Self/World and the birth of the new, as represented by the cover art depicting Nature blasting through one of the great icons of Civilization. From crushing doom to head-bobbing Camaro rock and hypnotic psych, &ldquo;Terminus&rdquo; is Snail&rsquo;s most varied work to date, rife with meaning and hidden messages; but most importantly, IT ROCKS.</p>

<p>This was the album 13 years in the making. Armed with old cassette demos and a few new tunes Snail entered the studio in May 2008 to finally record the lost second album. They completed the basic tracks at Matt's studio in Los Angeles and over the next 5 months overdubs were recorded at Mark's home near Seattle. Gear was abused, tube amps were blown and the result was an album that embodied all of Snail's suppressed musical expression - with fury!</p>
            <p> Analogous to the slow, relentless power of erosion, SNAIL melts mountains and reshapes earth with their latest offering, &quot;Blood.&quot; A band that once shared the stage with Stoner/Doom contemporaries SLEEP, SNAIL embarked on a 13-year sacred journey to Sheol from whence they recently emerged. Crushing proto-metal psychedelic fuzz-fests march on with sweet melodies shrouded by psyched-out oscillations. This is an album that should be measured on the Geologic Time Scale.</p>
            <p> <em>&quot;The path to a unique stoner sound is littered with seeds and stems, sick tones and thick riffs&mdash;and in this case, with cavernous clean vocals and catchy choruses. In 2009, Blood is an enjoyable departure from the social norms and mores of heaviness&quot;</em> - <a href="http://decibelmagazine.com/Content.aspx?ncid=333998" target="_blank">Decibel Magazine</a></p>

            </ol>
            <p>All Channels Are Open was released about a year after the S/T album and did not receive much label support. It consisted of one song from the S/T album (Full-Acid), three original Snail tunes and a cover of Falling Over The Edge, which was originally performed by Mark's previous band P.A.S.T.E. Falling Over The Edge was created by playing the original P.A.S.T.E. vinyl 7&quot; at the incorrect speed...slowing it down and making it heavier. Mark then laid backmasking and additional vocal tracks over the song. All songs were recorded on cassette 4-track except Full-Acid.</p>

            <p>&quot;<em>Snail is a way psyched out interstellar mind
feast...severely coated with lysergic residue and

<p>&quot;<em>While Snail's full-throttle jams stand on their own,

The record was to be distributed in 1995 with a future issue of Carbon 14 and the song had to be a cover tune. Snail chose to cover Boris The Spider by The Who and recorded it on cassette 4track.</p>
