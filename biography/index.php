<h1>Biography</h1>
<h2>THE LEGEND OF SNAIL</h2>
<p><img style="float:right;margin-left:10px" img src="../media/selftitled_sm.jpg" width="100" height="97" >Snail formed in 1992 consisting of singer Mark Johnson (The Crucified, PASTE, Blessing the Hogs), bassist Matt Lynch and drummer Marty Dodson. The eponymous first album (Big Deal Records), was well received by critics and garnered much praise in the press, as well as gaining a loyal following from peers like long time supporters Fu Manchu and Nebula.</p>
<p><img style="float:right;margin-left:10px" img src="../media/original_press_photo100w.jpg" width="100" height="76" />After the follow-up release of the DIY, 4-track cassette-recorded EP &quot;All Channels Are Open,&quot; Snail sadly succumbed to the &quot;sex, drugs, and Rock n Roll&quot; lifestyle and eroded to the point of breaking up. </p>
<h2>REIGN OF BLOOD</h2>
<p><img style="float:right; margin-left:10px; margin-bottom: 40px;" img src="../media/BloodFrontCover.jpg" width="100" height="88" >Snail reunited in 2008 after 15 years of slumber, added long-time friend and guitarist Eric Clausen, and unleashed &quot;Blood&quot; (Meteor City) - what many said was one of the Top Ten stoner/doom records of 2009. Not merely riff-rock, &quot;Blood&quot; combined fuzzy guitars and a pummeling rhythm section with layered, soaring melodies rarely heard in the genre. In a time of industry turmoil, the record went from blood-red to &quot;in the black.&quot; The record even attracted the attention of underground music legend Henry Rollins, getting multiple plays on his &quot;Fanatics&quot; radio show on influential Los Angeles station KCRW.</p>
<h2>THE END IS THE BEGINNING</h2>
<p><img style="float:right; margin-left:10px; margin-bottom: 10px;" img src="../media/Terminus_Cover_sm.jpg" width="100" height="100" />Snail's new album, &quot;Terminus,&quot; showcases all fresh material, infused with the enthusiasm of newly minted collaboration. Influences that were not evident in past works come to the fore, steeped in old-school metal and psychedelia. <br />
  The subject matter is noticeably more mature, as the entire record delves into the themes of mortality and its implications in our modern world. From crushing doom to head-bobbing Camaro rock and hypnotic psych, &quot;Terminus&quot; is Snail's most varied work to date; but most importantly, IT ROCKS.</p>
